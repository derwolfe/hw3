This is a hospital database that is implemented using doubly linked lists.

I have implemented a linkedlist as a class, and will use it multiple times throughout the code. Similar to string268 in the music DB assignment. I hope this makes the code easier to follow.

I will try to write some test cases for linkedlist to make sure it actually works.

For right now though, I will just assume it works, and write the code for the doct/pat/hospitals.
