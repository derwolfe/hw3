This is a hospital database that is implemented using doubly linked lists.

I have implemented a linkedlist as a class, and will use it multiple times throughout the code. Similar to string268 in the music DB assignment. I hope this makes the code easier to follow.

** My idea did not work, so I decided to try to make a template out of it. I was unable to get the template to compile. But, my test runs of the linkedlist.cpp/h ran successfully, as evinved by the mk_test file.

I understand the spirit of the assignment was to implement a linked list several times, within the class. I also believe I made several mistakes in the main.cpp file in trying to get file input using cmdstr. 

The template was supposed to be first used in the doctor class. I modified the makefile to call it as a dependency. I am not sure if that was the correct implementation.
